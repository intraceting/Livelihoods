                    Preliminary Draft - do not cite

                           Author's draft: 3

This is a preliminary draft of a portion of specification of a proposed
new version of the CIFS authentication protocol. It is supplied here as
a standalone document for ease of review; if accepted and implemented,
it may be incorporated into a future release of the CIFS specification.
(This specification is subject to change without notice and should not
be construed as a product commitment from Microsoft Corporation.)

The original protocol from which this version descends was designed more
than a decade ago; recently, quite a few weaknesses have been found in
previous versions. This latest revision is an attempt to repair those
weaknesses with as small a change to the protocol as possible, so that
it can be incrementally and rapidly deployed. In particular, it must not
be necessary for all users to change their passwords to deploy the
upgraded protocol. Also, efficiency is an issue, so some more robust MAC
schemes that could have been used weren't.

This portion of the specification describes the authentication protocol
abstracted from the implementation details, in order to make scrutiny of
its security properties easier. It also only describes the strongest of
several variants of the authentication protocol; a brief summary of the
other variants is at the end of the document, together with a
description of how the real protocols vary from this abstraction. The
full details of the protocol are in the CIFS Authentication
Specification document; a broader discussion of the security properties,
including other attacks, may be found in the CIFS Security
Considerations document.


1.1 Overview

Session authentication is done via a challenge response protocol based
upon the shared knowledge of the user's password. Message authentication
is done by attaching a message authentication code (MAC) to each
message.

The response is computed by DES encrypting a challenge composed of
nonces selected by the client and server with two keys derived from the
user's password, and extracting half of each of the results.

The MAC is a keyed-MD5 construction (see [RFC 1828]), using a key
derived from the user's password and the client and server nonces. Each
message is either of known fixed length or contains an explicit length,
and is longer than an MD5 block, which avoids the known weaknesses of
MD5 as a MAC (see [Kal 95]).  Each message includes an implicit sequence
number, to avoid replay.

We describe the authentication protocols as if the CIFS server keeps a
database of clients' passwords, but an implementation might actually
store the passwords on a key distribution server (KDS) and have servers
use a protocol outside the scope of this specification  to enable them
to perform the steps required by this protocol.


1.2 Definitions

Let

U         be the user's name, blank padded to 16 bytes
P(U)      be U's password
Ks, Ks'   be a 128 bit session key
Ka, Ka'   be a 56 bit DES key extracted from the first seven bytes of Ks
Kb, Kb'   be another 56 bit DES key extracted from the second seven
          bytes of Ks
Kc, Kc'   be another 56 bit DES key extracted from the last two bytes of
          Ks, padded with zeros
SN, SN'   be a 32 bit sequence number
Km, Km'   be a 44 byte key for a keyed-MD5 MAC
[s]<n:m>  be the "n" bytes of s starting at byte "m"
[s]<n>    be the first "n" bytes of s
a,b,…z    be the concatenation of the byte strings a, b, … z
{ m }K    be the DES encryption [FIPS] of the byte string m with key K
MD4(m)    be the MD4 message digest [RFC 1320] of the byte string m
MD5(m)    be the MD5 message digest [RFC 1321] of the byte string m
Z(n)      be a byte string of zeros of length n

CS        be an 8 byte nonce chosen by the server, used as a challenge


1.3 Application protocol messages

The application protocol being secured is a request/response protocol
that has the following characteristics. Authentication is carried out in
the process of setting up a session, during which session features are
negotiated, the exact details of which do not affect the authentication
protocol. Each of the elements of protocol messages is either a fixed
length byte string, or contains an explicit length, and is at least 32
bytes long;, and requests are guaranteed to be distinguishable from
responses.

Mneg      be a session negotiation request containing supported features
Mnegr     be a negotiation response indicating selected features
Msess     be a  session request
Msessr    be a session response
Mreq      be a subsequent protocol request
Mrsp      be a subsequent protocol response

1.4 Session authentication protocol

1. The client computes the session keys from the user's password,
initializes its sequence number, and sends a session negotiation request
to the server.

C:        Ks  = MD4(P(U))
          Ka = [Ks]<7>
          Kb = [Ks]<7:8>
          Kc = [Ks]<15:2>, Z(5)
          SN  = 0

C->S:     Mneg

2. The server responds with the features negotiated, and a challenge:

S->C:     Mnegr, CS

3. The client computes a response to the challenge. It computes the MAC
key, and the MAC of the message, and  send the user name, challenge
response, and session request parameters to the server.

C:        R = {CS}Ka, {CS}Kb, {CS}Kc
          Km = Ks, R
          MC = [MD5(Km, SN, Msess, U, R)]<8>

C->S:     Msess, U, R, MC

4. The server computes the keys by looking up the user's password, and
from the keys and the client's challenge, computes the expected response
and expected MAC for the request:

S:        Ks'  = MD4(P(U))
          Ka' = [Ks']<7>
          Kb' = [Ks']<7:8>
          Kc' = [Ks']<15:2>, Z(5)
          SN' = 0
          R'  = {CS}Ka', {CS}Kb', {CS}Kc'
          Km' = Ks, R
          MC' = [MD5(Km, SN', Msess, U, R)]<8>

5. If R' == R and MC' == MC, then the client has authenticated to the
server. The server computes the MAC of its response, then sends the
session acknowledgment message, with both nonces, then bumps its
sequence number

S:        MS  = [MD5(Km', SN', Msessr)]<8>

S->C:     Msessr, MS

S:        SN' = SN' + 1

6. The client checks if MS' == MS; if so,  then the server has
authenticated to the client, and the client's sequence number is
incremented.

C:        MS' = [MD5(Km, SN, Msessr, CC, CS)]<8>
          SN  = SN  + 1


1.5 Message authentication protocol

For each request/response interaction thereafter the following procedure
is used:

1. The client send the request together with a MAC of the request:

C->S:     Mreq, [MD5(Km, SN, Mreq)]<8>

2. The server checks the MAC, and if correct, sends the response, then
bumps its sequence number:

S->C:     Mrsp, [MD5(Km', SN', Mrsp)<8>
S:        SN' = SN' + 1

3. The client checks the MAC and if correct accepts the response and
bumps its sequence number:

C:        SN  = SN  + 1


1.6 Summary of other variants and differences

There are variants of the authentication protocols; they exist for
backwards compatibility. The variants are creating by taking certain
allowed combinations of the following differences:

· The session key Ks is computed differently.

· The message authentication protocol is omitted.

· A plaintext password may be sent

The feature negotiation step (the exchange of Mneg and Mnegr above)  is
where the exact variant is selected. Both client and server can force
the use of as strong a variant as they require to meet their security
policy.

The actual authentication protocols differ from the one described in the
following ways:

· The order of fields in messages may be different

· The MAC value is calculated by inserting the implicit sequence number
  into a field of the message, and computing the MAC; then that field
  is overwritten with the MAC value for transmission.

· Multiple requests or responses may be "batched"  together into one
  message, and single requests or responses may be spread out over
  multiple messages.

It is not believed that any of these differences affect the security of
the protocol. The full details of the protocol are in the CIFS
Authentication Specification document; a broader discussion of the
security properties, including other attacks, may be found in the CIFS
Security Considerations document.
