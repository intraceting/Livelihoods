There are 5 files which comprise the documentation for the CIFS protocol
and the CIFS extensions for enterprise networking. They are available in
both .doc (Word 95) and .txt formats

1. cifs6 is the main CIFS file sharing protocol spec.

2. cifsbrow is the spec for the browser

3. cifsrap2 is the spec for the RAP protocol and some remote
admin requests that use it
	- NetShareEnum
	- NetServerEnum2
	- NetServerGetInfo
	- NetShareGetInfo
	- NetWkstaUserLogon
	- NetWksatUserLogoff
	- NetUserGetInfo
	- NetWkstaGetInfo
	- SamOemChangePassword

4. cifsprt is the spec for CIFS printing.

5. cifslog is the spec for CIFS logon and passthrough authentication.



There are also 4 files that make up the older SMB protocol specs (they are
not pure ascii, they have some formatting characters in them
for any standard line printer):

1) COREP.TXT is the orginal core protocol developed for MSnet and PCLP.
It is the common protocol (ie least common denominator) spoken
by any SMB server (ie MSnet, Lan Manager, VMS SMB servers, XenixNet,
etc).

2) DOSEXTP.TXT is the LM 1.0 SMB protocol.

3) SMB.TXT is the LM 2.0 protocol.  Note: In the doc is calls
LM 2.0 as LM 1.2 (it's orginal name before being renamed to 
LM 2.0).

4) XEXTNP.TXT is the XenixNet SMB protocol.

Happy reading.
