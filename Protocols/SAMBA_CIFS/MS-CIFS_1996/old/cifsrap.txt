ABSTRACT

This specification defines how an RPC like mechanism may be implemented
using the Common Internet File System (CIFS) Transact2 SMB. Specific
examples are provided of how a CIFS client may request a CIFS server to
execute a function. The examples show complete details of the request
sent by the CIFS client and the response from the CIFS server.

INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


This document details an RPC like mechanism used by CIFS clients to
submit requests to CIFS servers and obtain the results of the request
back from the server.

For convenience, some sections from the CIFS specification have been
reproduced in part within this document. Note that the CIFS
specification should be considered to be the authoritative reference, in
case of any doubts, rather than this document.

2. Prerequisites and suggested reading

. Familiarity with Common Internet File Systems specification (CIFS)


3. Remote Administration Protocol overview

The Remote Administration Protocol (RAP) is similar to an RPC protocol,
in that:
. it is an at-most-once synchronous request-response protocol
. it is a framework that can be used for remotely requesting many
  different kinds of services
. it is designed  to allow (but not require) the programming interface
  to the protocol to be that of remotely executed procedure calls _
  which means that one thinks if the protocol in terms of marshaling
  and unmarshaling procedure call input and output arguments into
  messages and reliably transporting the messages to and from the
  client and server
Each RAP request is characterized by a set of ASCII descriptor strings
that are sufficient to be used to interpretively drive the marshaling
and unmarshaling process, if an implementation wanted to use them for
that purpose. These descriptor strings are included in each request
packet, and make the requests self-describing.

RAP is layered on the CIFS Transact2 SMB, which provides reliable
message delivery, security, and messages larger than the underlying
network maximum packet size. When used for RAP, the name field in the
Transact2 SMB is always set to "\PIPE\LANMAN". The Transact2 SMB is sent
on a session/connection that is established to the remote server using a
SessionSetupAndX SMB, and using a TID obtained by doing a
TreeConnectAndX SMB to a share named "IPC$".

[Refer to the CIFS specification for complete details on SMBs in
general, and the Transact2 SMB in particular. For convenience, relevant
portions from the CIFS specification have been reproduced here in
Appendix A. Note that the CIFS specification should be considered the
authoritative source of information, rather than Appendix A as far as
details on the Transact2 SMB are concerned.]

The model of a RAP service is that there are a few parameters as inputs
and outputs to the service, exactly one of which may be a buffer
descriptor that indicates the presence of a potentially much larger
input or output data buffer. An argument may be a scalar, pointer, fixed
length small array or struct, or a buffer descriptor. The data buffer
consists of entries followed by a heap. An entry consists of a primary


Leach, Naik                                         [Page 3]


INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


data struct and a sequence of  0 or more auxiliary data structs. An
input buffer must contain exactly one entry; an output buffer may
contain 0 or more. The heap is where data is stored that is referenced
by pointers in the entries. The parameters are described by a parameter
descriptor string; the primary data struct by a data descriptor string;
and the auxiliary data structs by an auxiliary data descriptor string.


4. Remote Administration Protocol

A RAP service request is sent to the server encapsulated in a Transact2
request SMB and the server sends back a Transact2 SMB response. An
attribute of the Transact2 SMB is that it divides the payload of request
and response messages into two sections: a parameters section and a data
section. As might be expected from the nomenclature, RAP service
parameters are sent in the parameters section of a Transact2 SMB, and
the data buffer in the data section. Therefore, to define a service
protocol, it is necessary to define the formats of the parameter and
data sections of the Transact2 request and response.

This is done in two stages. First, a C-like declaration notation is used
to define descriptor strings, and then the descriptor strings define the
formats of the  parameter and data sections.. Note well: even though the
declarations may look like a programming interface, they are not: they
are a notation for describing the contents of RAP requests and
responses; an implementation on any particular system can use any
programming interface to RAP services that is appropriate to that
system.

4.1 Notation

Parameter descriptor strings are defined using a C-like function
declaration; data descriptor and auxiliary data descriptor strings are
defined using a C-like structure declaration.

Parameter descriptor strings are defined with the following C-like
function declaration syntax:
    rap-service     = "unsigned short" service-name "(" parameters ");"
    service-name        = <upper and lower case alpha and numeric>
The return type of the function is always "unsigned short", and
represents the status code from the function. The service-name is for
documentation purposes.
    parameters      = parameter [ ";" parameter ]
The parameter descriptor string for the service is the concatenation of
the descriptor characters for the parameters.
    parameter       = [ "const" ] param-data-type parameter-name
                      [ "[" size "]" ]
    param-data-type = <from parameter descriptor tables below>
    parameter-name      = <upper and lower case alpha and numeric>
    size                = <string of ASCII 0-9>
The descriptor character for a parameter is determined by looking up the
data-type in the tables below for request or response parameter
descriptors. The parameter-name is for documentation purposes. If there

INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


is a size following the parameter-name, then it is placed in the
descriptor string following the descriptor character.

Data and auxiliary data descriptor strings are defined  with the
following C-like structure declaration syntax:
    rap-struct      = "struct" struct-name "{" members "}"
The descriptor string for the struct is the concatenation of the
descriptor characters for the members. The struct-name is for
documentation purposes.
    members         = member [  ";" member ]
    member          = member-data-type member-name [ "[" size "]" ]
    member-data-type    = <from data descriptor tables below>
The descriptor character for a member is determined by looking up the
data-type in the tables below for data descriptors. The member-name is
for documentation purposes. If there is a size following the member-
name, then it is placed in the descriptor string following the
descriptor character.

4.2 Descriptors

The following section contain tables that specify the descriptor
character and the notation for each data type for that data type.

INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


Descriptor  Data Type        Format
==========  =========        =====
g           BYTE *           indicates a byte is  to be received. May
                             be followed by an ASCII number indicating

                             indicates the number of entries returned


4.2.3 Data Descriptors


Descriptor  Data Type        Format
==========  =========        =====
W           unsigned short   indicates data type of 16 bit integer
                             (word). Descriptor char may be followed by
                             an ASCII number indicating the number of
                             16 bit words present
D           unsigned long    indicates data type of 32 bit integer
                             (dword). Descriptor char may be followed
                             by an ASCII number indicating the number
                             of 32 bit words present
B           BYTE             indicates item of data type 8 bit byte
                             (octet). The indicated number of bytes are
                             present  in the data. Descriptor char may
                             be followed by an ASCII number indicating
                             the number of 8 bit bytes present
O           NULL             indicates a NULL pointer
z           char *           indicates a 32 bit pointer to a NULL
                             terminated ASCII string is present in the
                             response parameter area. The actual string
                             is in the response data area and the
                             pointer in the parameter area points to
                             the string in the data area. The high word
                             of the pointer should be ignored. The
                             converter word present in the response
                             parameter section should be subtracted
                             from the low 16 bit value to obtain an
                             offset into the data area indicating where
                             the data area resides.
N           AUXCOUNT         indicates number of auxiliary data
                             structures. The transaction response data
                             section contains an unsigned 16 bit number
                             corresponding to this data item.


4.3 Transaction Request Parameters section

The parameters and data being sent and received are described by ASCII
descriptor strings. These descriptor strings are described in section
4.2.



Leach, Naik                                         [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


The parameters section of the Transact2 SMB request contains the
following (in the order described)
. The function number: an unsigned short 16 bit integer identifying the
  function being remoted
. The parameter descriptor string: a null terminated ASCII string
. The data descriptor string: a null terminated ASCII string.
. The request parameters, as described by the parameter descriptor
  string, in the order that the request parameter descriptor characters
  appear in the parameter descriptor string
. An optional auxiliary data descriptor string: a null terminated ASCII
  string. It will be present if there is an auxiliary data structure
  count in the primary data struct (an "N" descriptor in the data
  descriptor string).

RAP requires that the length of the return parameters be less than or
equal to the length of the parameters being sent; this requirement is
made to simply buffer management in implementations. This is reasonable
as the functions were designed to return data in the data section and
use the return parameters for items like data length, handles, etc. If
need be, this restriction can be circumvented by filling in some pad
bytes into the parameters being sent.

4.4 Transaction Request Data section

The Data section for the transaction request is present if the parameter
description string contains an "s" (SENDBUF) descriptor. If present, it
contains:
. A primary data struct, as described by the data descriptor string
. Zero or more instances of the auxiliary data struct, as described by
  the auxiliary data descriptor string. The number of instances is
  determined by the value of the an auxiliary data structure count
  member of the primary data struct, indicated by the "N" (AUXCOUNT)
  descriptor. The auxiliary data is present only if the auxiliary data
  descriptor string is non null.
. Possibly some pad bytes
. The heap: the data referenced by pointers in the primary and
  auxiliary data structs.

4.5 Transaction Response Parameters section

The response sent by the server contains a parameter section which
consists of:
. A 16 bit integer indicating the status or return code. The possible
  values for different functions are different.
. A 16 bit converter word, used adjust pointers to information in the
  response data section. Pointers returned within the response buffer
  are 32 bit pointers. The high order 16 bit word should be ignored.
  The converter word needs to be subtracted from the low order  16 bit
  word to arrive at an offset into the response buffer.
. The response parameters, as described by the parameter descriptor
  string, in the order that the response parameter descriptor
  characters appear in the parameter descriptor string.

4.6 Transaction Response Data section


Leach, Naik                                         [Page 7]


INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


The Data section for the transaction response is present if the
parameter description string contains an "r" (RCVBUF) descriptor. If
present, it contains:
. Zero or more entries. The number of entries is determined by the
  value of the entry count parameter, indicated by the "e"(ENTCOUNT)
  descriptor. Each entry contains:
        . A primary data struct, as described by the data descriptor
          string
        . Zero or more instances of the auxiliary data struct, as
          described by the auxiliary data descriptor string. The number
          of instances is determined by the value of the AUXCOUNT
          member of the primary data struct (whose descriptor is "N").
          The auxiliary data is present only if the auxiliary data
          descriptor string is non null.
. Possibly some pad bytes
. The heap: the data referenced by pointers in the primary and
  auxiliary data structs.

5. NetShareEnum

The NetShareEnum RAP function retrieves information about each shared
resource on a CIFS server. The definition is:

 unsigned short NetShareEnum(
   unsigned short       sLevel;
   RCVBUF       pbBuffer;
   RCVBUFLEN    cbBuffer;
   ENTCOUNT     pcEntriesRead;
   unsigned short       *pcTotalAvail;
 );

 where:

   sLevel specifies the level of detail returned and must have the
   value of 1.

   pbBuffer points to the buffer to receive the returned data. If the
   function is successful, the buffer contains a sequence of
   SHARE_INFO_1 structures (defined later).

   cbBuffer specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by
   the pbBuffer parameter.

   pcEntriesRead points to a 16 bit variable that receives a count of
   the number of shared resources enumerated in the buffer. This
   count is valid only if NetShareEnum returns the NERR_Success or
   ERROR_MORE_DATA values.

   pcTotalAvail points to a 16-bit variable that receives a count of
   the total number of shared resources. This count is valid only if
   NetShareEnum returns the NERR_Success or ERROR_MORE_DATA values.

Transaction Request Parameters section



Leach, Naik                                         [Page 8]


INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


The Transaction request parameters section in this instance contains:

. The 16 bit function number for NetShareEnum which is 0.
. The parameter descriptor string which is "WrLeh".
. The data descriptor string for the (returned) data which is "B13BWz"
. The actual parameters as described by the parameter descriptor
  string.

The parameters are:
. A 16 bit integer with a value of 1 (corresponding to the "W" in the
  parameter descriptor string. This represents the level of detail the
  server is expected to return
. A 16 bit integer that contains the size of the receive buffer.


Transaction Request Data section

There is no data or auxiliary data to send as part of the request.


Transaction Response Parameters section

The transaction response parameters section consists of:
. A 16 bit word indicating the return status. The possible values are:

Code                        Value  Description
NERR_Success                0      No errors encountered
ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED         5       User has insufficient privilege
ERROR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED 65     Network access is denied
ERROR_MORE_DATA             234    Additional data is available
NERR_ServerNotStarted       2114   The server service on the remote
                                   computer is not running
NERR_BadTransactConfig      2141   The server is not configured for
                                   transactions, IPC$ is not shared

. A 16 bit "converter" word.
. A 16 bit number representing the number of entries returned.
. A 16 bit number representing the total number of available entries.
  If the supplied buffer is large enough, this will equal the number of
  entries returned.

Transaction Response Data section

The return data section consists of a number of SHARE_INFO_1 structures.
The number of such structures present is determined by the third entry
(described above) in the return parameters section.

The SHARE_INFO_1 structure is defined as:

    struct SHARE_INFO_1 {
        char                shi1_netname[13]
        char                shi1_pad;
        unsigned short  shi1_type
        char            *shi1_remark;


Leach, Naik                                         [Page 9]


INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


    }

where:

   shi1_netname contains a null terminated ASCII string that
   specifies the share name of the resource.

   shi1_pad aligns the next data strructure element to a word
   boundary.

   shi1_type contains an integer that specifies the type of the
   shared resource. The possible values are:

Name           Value   Description
STYPE_DISKTREE 0       Disk Directory Tree
STYPE_PRINTQ   1       Printer Queue
STYPE_DEVICE   2       Communications device
STYPE_IPC      3       Inter process communication (IPC)

   shi1_remark points to a null terminated ASCII string that contains
   a comment abthe shared resource. The value for shi1_remark is null
   for ADMIN$ and IPC$ share names.  The shi1_remark pointer is a 32
   bit pointer. The higher 16 bits need to be ignored. The converter
   word returned in the parameters section needs to be subtracted
   from the lower 16 bits to calculate an offset into the return
   buffer where this ASCII string resides.

   In case there are multiple SHARE_INFO_1 data structures to return,
   the server may put all these fixed length structures in the return
   buffer, leave some space and then put all the variable length data
   (the actual value of the shi1_remark strings) at the end of the
   buffer.

INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


   sLevel specifies the level of detail (0 or 1) requested.

   pbBuffer points to the buffer to receive the returned data. If the
   function is successful, the buffer contains a sequence of
   server_info_x structures, where x is 0 or 1, depending on the
   level of detail requested.

   cbBuffer specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by
   the pbBuffer parameter.

   pcEntriesRead points to a 16 bit variable that receives a count of
   the number of servers enumerated in the buffer. This count is
   valid only if NetServerEnum2 returns the NERR_Success or
   ERROR_MORE_DATA values.

   pcTotal Avail points to a 16 bit variable that receives a count of
   the total number of available entries. This count is valid only if
   NetServerEnum2 returns the NERR_Success or ERROR_MORE_DATA values.

    fServerType specifies the type or types of computers to enumerate.
    Computers that match at least one of the specified types are
    returned in the buffer. Possible values are defined in the request
    parameters section.

   pszDomain points to a null-terminated string that contains the
   name of the workgroup in which to enumerate computers of the
   specified type or types. If the pszDomain parameter is a null
   string or a null pointer, servers are enumerated for the current
   domain of the computer.

INTERNET-DRAFT   CIFS Remote Admin Protocol     January 10, 1997


The return data section consists of a number of SHARE_INFO_1 structures.
The number of such structures present is determined by the third entry
(described above) in the return parameters section.

At level detail 0, the Transaction response data section contains a
number of SERVER_INFO_0 data structure. The number of such structures is
equal to the 16 bit number returned by the server in the third parameter
in the Transaction response parameter section. The SERVER_INFO_0 data
structure is defined as:

    struct SERVER_INFO_0 {
        char        sv0_name[16];
    };

 where:

   sv0_name is a null-terminated string that specifies the name of a
   computer or domain .

At level detail 1, the Transaction response data section contains a
number of SERVER_INFO_1 data structure. The number of such structures is
equal to the 16 bit number returned by the server in the third parameter
in the Transaction response parameter section. The SERVER_INFO_1 data
structure is defined as:

    struct SERVER_INFO_1 {
        char            sv1_name[16];
        char            sv1_version_major;

        unsigned long   sv1_type;
        char        *sv1_comment_or_master_browser;
    };

   sv1_name contains a null-terminated string that specifies the name
   of a computer.

   sv1_version_major specifies the major release version number of
   the networking software the server is running. This is entirely
   informational and something the caller of the NetServerEnum2
   function gets to see.

   sv1_version_minor specifies the minor release version number of
   the networking software the server is running. This is entirely
   informational and something the caller of the NetServerEnum2
   function gets to see.

   sv1_type specifies the type of software the computer is running.
   The member can be one or a combination of the values defined above
   in the Transaction request parameters section for fServerType.

   sv1_comment_or_master_browser points to a null-terminated string. If
   the sv1_type indicates that the entry is for a domain, this
   specifies the name of the domain master browser; otherwise, it

   specifies a comment describing the server. The comment can be a null
   string or the pointer may be a null pointer.

   In case there are multiple SERVER_INFO_1 data structures to
   return, the server may put all these fixed length structures in
   the return buffer, leave some space and then put all the variable
   length data (the actual value of the sv1_comment strings) at the
   end of the buffer.

There is no auxiliary data to receive.

7. NetServerGetInfo

The NetServerGetInfo function returns information about the specified
server. The definition is:

   unsigned short       *pcbTotalAvail;
 );

 where:

   sLevel specifies the level of detail returned.  (Legal values are
   0 and 1)

   pbBuffer points to the buffer to receive the returned data.

   cbBuffer specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by
   the pbBuffer parameter.

   pcbTotalAvail points to a  16 bit variable that receives a count of
   the total number of bytes of information available. This count is
   valid only if NetServerGetInfo returns the
   NERR_Success or ERROR_MORE_DATA values.

   The return value is one of the following:

Transaction Request Parameters section

  receive buffer needs to be.

Transaction Response Data section

At level detail 0, the Transaction response data section contains a
SHARE_INFO_0 data structure, which is defined as:

    struct SHARE_INFO_0 {
        char            shi1_netname[13]
    }


where:

   shi0_netname contains an ASCIIZ string that specifies the share
   name of the resource.

At level detail 1, the Transaction response data section contains a
SHARE_INFO_1 data structure, which is defined as:

    struct SHARE_INFO_1 {

   section needs to be subtracted from the lower 16 bits to calculate
   an offset into the return buffer where this ASCII string resides.

At level detail 2, the Transaction response data section contains a
SHARE_INFO_2 data structure, which is defined as:

    struct SHARE_INFO_2 {
        char                shi2_netname[13]
        char                shi2_pad;

STYPE_IPC      3       Inter process
                       communication (IPC)

   shi2_remark is a pointer to a null terminated ASCII string
   specifying a comment for the share

   shi2_permissions specifies the permissions on the shared resource
   if the CIFS server is operating with share level security. The
   values are this element can take are defined as a series of bit
   masks that may be OR'ed with each other. The bit mask values are:

Name             Bit Mask Value Description
ACCESS_READ      0x01           Permission to read & execute from resource

                                modification, etc
ACCESS_PERM      0x40           Permission to change permissions on the
                                resource
ACCESS_ALL       0x7F           All of the above permissions

   shi2_max_uses specifies the maximum number of current uses the
   shared resource can accommodate. A Value of -1 indicates there is
   no limit.

   shi2_current_uses specifies the current number of connections to
   the resource

   shi2_path point to an ASCIIZ string that contains the local (on
   the remote CIFS server) path  name of the shared resource.
   .  For printer resources, shi2_path specifies  the name of the
      printer queue being shared
   .  For disk devices, shi2_path specifies the path being shared
   .  For communication device queues, shi2_path specifies the name of
      the of the communication device
   .  For ADMIN$ or IPC$ resources, shi2_path must be a null pointer

   shi2_passwd specifies the password for the resource in case the
   CIFS server is running with share level security. For CIFS servers
   running with user level security, this field is set to null and is
   ignored.

   shi2_pad2 is just a pad byte

   All of the pointers to an ASCII string in this data structure
   (shi2_remark and shi2_path) need to be treated specially. The
   pointer is a 32 bit pointer. The higher 16 bits need to be
   ignored. The converter word returned in the parameters section
   needs to be subtracted from the lower 16 bits to calculate an
   offset into the return buffer where this ASCII string resides.

There is no auxiliary data in the response.

9. NetwkstaUserLogon

This is a function executed on a remote CIFS server to log on a user.
The purpose is to perform checks such as whether the specified user is
permitted to logon from the specified computer, whether the specified
user is permitted to log on at the given moment, etc. as well as perform
housekeeping and statistics updates.

There is a password field in the parameters for this function. However,
this field is always set to null before the function is sent on the
wire, in order to preserve security. The remote CIFS server ignores this
meaningless password that is sent. The remote CIFS server ensures
security by checking that the user name and computer name that are in
the request parameters are the same used to establish the session and
connection to the IPC$ share on the remote CIFS server.

The definition is:

specially. The  pointer is a 32 bit pointer. The higher 16 bits need
to be ignored. The converter word returned in the parameters section
needs to be subtracted from the lower 16 bits to calculate an offset
into the return buffer where this ASCII string resides.

       domain controller.

  usri11_country_code specifies the country code for the user's language
       of choice.

  usri11_workstations points to a null terminated ASCII string that
       contains the names of workstations the user may log on from.
       There may be up to 8 workstations, with the names separated by
       commas. A null strings indicates there are no restrictions.

  usri11_max_storage specifies the maximum amount of disk space the user
       can occupy. A value of 0xffffffff indicates there are no
       restrictions.

  usri11_units_per_week specifies the equal number of time units into
       which a week is divided. This value must be equal to 168.

  usri11_logon_hours points to a 21 byte (168 bits) string that
       specifies the time during which the user can log on. Each bit
       represents one unique hour in a week. The first bit (bit 0, word
       0) is Sunday, 0:00 to 0:59, the second bit (bit 1, word 0) is

       Sunday, 1:00 to 1:59 and so on. A null pointer indicates there
       are no restrictions.

  usri11_code_page specifies the code page for the user's language of
       choice

All of the pointers in this data structure need to be treated
specially. The  pointer is a 32 bit pointer. The higher 16 bits need
to be ignored. The converter word returned in the parameters section
needs to be subtracted from the lower 16 bits to calculate an offset
into the return buffer where this ASCII string resides.

There is no auxiliary data in the response.

Transaction SMBs

These SMBs are used both to retrieve bulk data from the server (e.g.:
enumerate shares, etc.) and to change the server's state (EG: add a new
share, change file permissions, etc.)  Transaction requests are also
unusual because they can have a multiple part request and/or a multiple
part response.  For this reason, transactions are handled as a set of
sequenced commands to the server.  Each part of a request is sent as a
sequenced command using the same Mid value and an increasing Seq value.
The server responds to each request piece except the last one with a
response indicating that the server is ready for the next piece.  The
last piece is responded to with the first piece of the result data.  The
client then sends a transaction secondary SMB with ParameterDisplacement
set to the number of parameter bytes received so far and
DataDisplacement set to the number of data bytes received so far and
ParameterCount, ParameterOffset, DataCount, and DataOffset set to zero
(0).  The server responds with the next piece of the transaction result.
The process is repeated until all of the response information has been
received.  When the transaction has been completed, the redirector must
send another sequenced command (an echo SMB will do fine) to the server
to allow the server to know that the final piece was received and that
resources allocated to the transaction command may be released.
The flow is as follows, where (S) is the SequenceNumber,  (N) is the
number of request packets to be sent from the client to the server, and
(M) is the number of response packets to be sent by the server to the
client:

In order to allow the server to detect clients which have been powered
off, have crashed, etc., the client must send commands to the server
periodically if it has resources open on the server.  If nothing has
been received from a client for awhile, the server will assume that the
client is no longer running and disconnect the client.  This includes
closing any files that the client had open at the time and releasing any
resources being used on behalf of the client.  Clients should at least
send an echo SMB to the server every four (4) minutes if there is
nothing else to send.  The server will disconnect clients after a
configurable amount of time which cannot be less than five (5) minutes.
(Note: the NT server has a default timevalue of 15 minutes.)

13.1.1 TRANSACTIONS

SMB_COM_TRANSACTION performs a symbolically named transaction.  This
transaction is known only by a name (no file handle used).
SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2 likewise performs a transaction, but a word
parameter is used to identify the transaction instead of a name.
SMB_COM_NT_TRANSACTION is used for commands that potentially need to
transfer a large amount of data (greater than 64K bytes).

TBD. This will be a note to explain how the descriptor strings can be
used to drive a marshaling engine that can automatically marshal and
unmarshal RAP messages and call local APIs whose calling sequences
closely match the format of the RAP services.
