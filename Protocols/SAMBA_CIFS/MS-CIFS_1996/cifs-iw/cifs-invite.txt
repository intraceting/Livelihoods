Dear CIFS Developer:

Microsoft cordially invites you to attend the first Common Internet File
System (CIFS) Implementor's Workshop. CIFS provides a standard, open and
cross-platform remote file system protocol for the Internet, enabling
groups of users to work together and share documents across the Internet
or within their corporate intranets.


This two-day event will be held Monday August 26 and Tuesday August  27
1996 on Microsoft's corporate campus in Redmond, Washington.  The goals
for this event are to: 1) ensure broad interoperability of CIFS
implementations on all platforms; and 2) to provide a forum for detailed
working sessions on the draft CIFS specification. Discussions will be
led by senior developers and program managers from Microsoft and other
CIFS vendors. Your participation will help ensure that CIFS technology
is open, published and widely available for all computer users.


The presentations will be highly technical, and a strong working
knowledge of SMB networking is presumed. This event will provide
detailed information about CIFS technology for both intranet and
Internet applications.  In addition Microsoft will provide details on
CIFS implementation issues not yet fully documented in the
specification. There will be ample time provided for you to provide
technical feedback.


Because conference space is limited, please send us your confirmation by
August 16, 1996. You will not be admitted to the conference without a
confirmed registration.



To confirm your attendance, please fax your completed registration form
to the attention of Lori Koidahl, Building 12 South, 206-936-8762, or
confirm via email to a-lorik@microsoft.com. Confirmation packets
outlining suggested accommodations, design specification, final agenda,
and details on the Redmond, Washington event location will be sent out
after we receive your RSVP.


We look forward to your participation in the first CIFS Implementor's
Workshop.


Sincerely,
